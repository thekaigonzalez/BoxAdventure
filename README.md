# Box Adventure

Box Adventure is a game inspired by games such as Geometry dash, Boxel Rebound, and more, combining successful ideas from other games to create a fun platformer where you can dash, hop, and run around different maps that are created by the community!

The only limit is your imagination. You can choose to download maps from the official map repository (https://github.com/thekaigonzalez/BAMaps) or create your own using the documentation.

Box Adventure uses Godot, and supports all platforms. (Except for iOS) It allows users to create custom maps (GAMEMODES), and there is going to possibly be a map creator in the future.

You can customize BA and make it yours, with custom characters, sounds, and much more.

If you feel that BA doesnâ€™t contain the feature you would like, it is open source and you can contribute any feature you would like, or, if you prefer to keep it private, you can do that too :)

BA is written with performance in mind, any realism features are only enabled if the user wants them.

And: you can create fancy experiences for your downloaders.
